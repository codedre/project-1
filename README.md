#WDI Project 1: Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

## User Stories
1. As a user, I should be able to select two cards so that I can check to see if they match.
2. As a user, I should be able to track how long I have been playing so that I can improve the next time.
3. As a user, I should be able to view my best time so I can improve the next time I play.
4. As a user, I should be able to see pairs that I have matched so I do not select them again.
5. As a user, I should be able to see when I have made my first selection so that I can make my next selection.

##First Brainstorm
From go I wanted a theme for my game that not only would determine the look and character of the game but also could be something that would mimic a real world request of me by a client or digital agency. I looked to the right of my computer and saw an empty fry container from by my mid-day snack.

McDonalds is a huge brand and there are a lot of ways they get their customers (myself included) excited by having fun games like monopoly and other contest that reward you with free food items for playing.

###The Tie In

Now that I have my theme I needed to find a way to make this relevant to their bottom line which is to get more people in the door. What I am proposing in this project is to create a simple memory game using McDonalds menu offerings that rewards you with a coupon to use on your next visit to McDonalds.

###Deliverable Tiers

####Bronze
- Simple memory game that keeps track of how long it took you to finish
- Game meets the basic requirements to play a memory game and is functional
- Design is at a minimum and is restricted to game board and titles
- McDonalds branding is restricted to name and logo

####Silver
- Memory game is functional and has 3 game difficulties
- Game theme and design looks like finished product
- Coupon is generated after each win

####Gold
- Memory game is functional, has 5 difficulties
- Coupon are generated after conditions are met
- Coupon incentives are tracked and displayed
- External links to McDonalds site and other partners are displayed
- Professional design with animations

##Inspiration
Outside of the obvious I was inspired by the viral campaign that launched mid 2015 for movie straight outta Compton (http://straightouttasomewhere.com). I really liked how a simple program that just takes an input and places it on a simple background that you could share on social media made a huge impact on pop culture for a few weeks. If you scroll further on the website you can see musicians, actors, and athletes all participating in the campaign. So I wanted this game to act as a simple product that aids in the promotion of McDonald's in a similar way that campaign did for the movie.

##Technologies Used
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Google fonts
- HTML
- CSS
- Trello (project management)

##Approach
To start I used my tic-tac-toe game as a base for my project and then started small to achieve my bronze MVP. Starting with just 4 squares I built all of my game logic and scaled up from there.

##Future Development
Some things I did not get to complete are:
- add advertisements
- parse the completed game times and store them in the best times table
- store values in the browsers cashed memory so the best times stay in the table when you navigate away from the page

##Contributors
Everyone in my class (class 5) for allowing me to bounce ideas off them as well sharing their code to view how others solve similar problems.
