# WDI Project 1: Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

## User Stories
1. As a user, I should be able to select two cards so that I can check to see if they match.
2. As a user, I should be able to track how long I have been playing so that I can improve the next time.
3. As a user, I should be able to view my best time so I can improve the next time I play.
4. As a user, I should be able to see pairs that I have matched so I do not select them again.
5. As a user, I should be able to see when I have made my first selection so that I can make my next selection.

##Fist Brainstorm
From go I wanted a theme for my game that not only would determine the look and character of the game but also could be something that would mimic a real world request of me by a client or digital agency. I looked to the right of my computer and saw an empty fry container from by my mid-day snack.

McDonalds is a huge brand and there are a lot of ways the get their customers (myself included) excited by have fun games like monopoly and other contest that reward you with free food items for playing.

###The Tie In

Now that I have my theme I needed to find a way to make this relevant to their bottom line which is to get more people in the door. What I am proposing in this project is to create a simple memory game using McDonalds menu offerings that rewards you with a coupon to use on your next visit to McDonalds.
